**** Task 1 ****:
In this task, i have send temperature and humidity data on firebase.



**** Task 2 ****:
In this task, i have changed timestamp to be in Pakistan time. The timestamp is formatted as a 12-hour time (AM/PM), and the data is stored in Firebase . I have used NTPClient library. This library helps with syncing time from an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server to get the current time.
